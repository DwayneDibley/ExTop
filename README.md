# ExTop

ExTop is a GUI implementation of the UNIX top command. It was written to
make the development of ElixirWx more interesting. It does not have many bells
and whistles, but it does work, and may be useful to someone.

As ElixirWx is a moving target at the moment, the current ElixixrWx code is
included in the lib directory. This means that it will be immune to any
future breaking changes in ElixirWx.
